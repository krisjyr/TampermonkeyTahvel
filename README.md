# Tahvel remake with TamperMonkey


### Pay attention to the comments at the beginning of the script! The `// @require` demands the computer's full path to the `login.user.js` file, so make sure you change that. Otherwise the VS Code connection won't work.
### Not that the TamperMonkey environment is bad, we just love intellisense :)
